// The cutoff is a time budget, not a quality judgement. Exact solving costs
// ~2.8x per extra card still in play (measured in bench/endgame-timing.mjs):
// 12 cards is ~200 ms, 13 is ~630 ms, 16 is 22 s. Twelve keeps every
// suggestion under a fifth of a second.
//
// In a normal game (about 4 picks and 11 discards) the exact phase begins
// around the seventh action, so it covers every decision that actually settles
// which chest you end up with.
